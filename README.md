# SHOWS-and-Tell
[Launch SHOWS & Tell site](https://justinmarchi.github.io/SHOWS-and-Tell.github.io/)

We wanted to create a sleek and simple tool to find bands and provide the user with
information about the upcoming shows they are playing. This included venues where they
are playing and an easy link to purchase tickets.

In addition, we’ve paired the user’s selection with a taste
comparison engine (that uses AI) that returns related artists
the user may also like (similar to a Netflix recommendation).
